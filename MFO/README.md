# Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO)

This project implements the **Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithm**, a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization technique designed to solve complex optimization problems. The algorithm mimics the navigation behavior of moths, which use a logarithmic spiral flying pattern toward light sources. In the MFO algorithm, a set of moths explores the search space, while flames (elite solutions) guide them toward better solutions. Over iterations, moths converge to optimal or near-optimal solutions.

This implementation is based on the original MFO paper, ensuring an accurate representation of the algorithm's principles and behavior. The algorithm is tested on five well-known benchmark functions: **Griewank, Rastrigin, Sphere, Rosenbrock, and Ackley functions**. The optimization process is visualized using GIFs that show the movement of moths towards flames during the optimization.

## Algorithm Explanation
The Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithm is inspired by the natural behavior of moths navigating using a transverse orientation mechanism. The mathematical model behind the algorithm consists of three main components:

1. **Moth Movement**: Each moth follows a logarithmic spiral path towards a flame (elite solution) in the search space. The movement is defined as:

   ```
   S(M_i, F_j) = D_i * e^(b * t) * cos(2Ï€t) + F_j
   ```
   
   where:
   - `S(M_i, F_j)` is the new position of moth `M_i` moving towards flame `F_j`,
   - `D_i` is the distance between the moth and the flame, calculated as `|F_j - M_i|`,
   - `b` is a constant defining the shape of the logarithmic spiral,
   - `t` is a random number in `[-1, 1]`,
   - `F_j` is the position of the flame.

2. **Flame Update Mechanism**: Flames represent the best solutions found so far. In each iteration, the number of flames decreases to emphasize exploitation in later stages of optimization:

   ```
   N_f = round(N - (t * (N - 1)) / T)
   ```
   
   where:
   - `N_f` is the number of flames,
   - `N` is the total number of moths,
   - `t` is the current iteration number,
   - `T` is the maximum number of iterations.

3. **Exploration and Exploitation**: The search is balanced between exploration (searching new areas) and exploitation (refining known good areas) by dynamically adjusting the number of flames and moth movement patterns.
